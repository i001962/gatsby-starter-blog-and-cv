"Decisions based on average numbers are wrong, on average." -Dr. Sam L. Savage

I've been collecting notes over the years and I've been thinking about how best to share them with others. They are in a [popstack](https://app.popstack.ai/Kevin/Kevin's%20Compendium%20-%20Probability%20Management/5cc1ec42af1274057ac0d4ae) so each information fragment may be reused and streamed into conversations and reassemble into new meaningful contexts but I digress.. this post is about the arithmetic of uncertainty.

Let's start with Probability Management. The big idea here is to represent uncertainties as data arrays called SIPs (stochastic information packet for the math geeks). SIPs obey both the laws of arithmetic and the laws of probability. Hence the arithmetic of uncertainty. 

Why is this important? Because it is now as easy to represent uncertainty as it is to represent a single average number. There have been some very exciting advancements in probability management that make it easier to share and reuse probability distributions. Why should organizations embrace probability management techniques?

- To cure the Flaw of Averages
- Make chance-informed decisions
- Roll-up risks and opportunities across the enterprise, blockchains, government agencies etc
