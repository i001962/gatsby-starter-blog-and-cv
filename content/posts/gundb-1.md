"The app logged into me." - Mark Nadal

The internet is a magical place. It connects us with new people and ideas; it allows for instantaneous communication and entertainment. In the new, data-driven economy where we all are interconnected, and companies constantly collect our personal data to make decisions about us, securing that information has never been more critical. But there's another dark side - data breaches that expose our personal information to the world. What if we could take back control of our privacy?

Data protection has been the number one issue for app developers since at least 2018. Data breaches are more likely than ever before. Today there are over 100 distinct data localization laws to contend with as regulators around the world try to put up guardrails to protect consumers. App developers must ask themselves, is storing their customers' sensitive information the right thing to do? Remember the 1983 movie War Games?

Today's situation reminds me a lot of  [War Games](https://www.amazon.com/WarGames-Matthew-Broderick/dp/B0011EQBOS). David Lightman (played brilliantly by Mathew Broderick) logged into an ultra-high security computer while hacking his way through phone lines to play some risky games. The game creator, Professor Falken, says, "There's no way to win. The game itself is pointless!" If your app stores sensitive information, you should be asking yourself, "Is it worth it to store it on a server that could be compromised at any time?"

Well, the game is not pointless, the internet is indeed magical, and privacy is essential. Sadly the internet has been concentrated into a small group of large companies that store your app's data. This makes data breaches worth the effort.

There is a winning move! The best way to assure data privacy is by encrypting sensitive data at the time of creation. Encryption scrambles your data so that not even you can read it. It also ensures that only authorized people see the information if they are given access rights. The next best thing is not to store the data in a centralized cloud service. I would argue that not storing the data is the best way to assure data privacy and limit the risk of a data breach. Hackers can't take something from app developers that the app developers don’t have. That's right. Create apps that don't centrally store sensitive data. It's the user's data, after all. 

Fortunately, there are open-source projects that are tackling the challenge and making privacy and decentralization easy. One of my favorites is called Gun. The data synchronization protocol assures your app's data stays private by storing sensitive information in an encrypted format on a decentralized network. A network that can never be taken down.

Let's make the internet a magical place again. If the apps you develop are processing sensitive data that needs to be kept private from prying eyes, it’s time to start looking into how to store and encrypt data on a decentralized network. It's a different way of thinking about data ownership. As Mark Nadal, Gun's creator, said, "The app logged into me."
