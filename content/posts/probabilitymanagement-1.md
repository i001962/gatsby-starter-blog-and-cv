"Decisions based on average numbers are wrong, on average." -Dr. Sam L. Savage

Do you know the arithmetic of uncertainty? It's a concept that is used to describe how much risk/opportunity there is in any situation. It's about measuring and quantifying uncertainties, especially those with unknown probabilities or outcomes. The more uncertain something is, the higher its level of variance will be. And it goes both ways: lower variability can indicate a greater degree of certainty as well. Uncertainty has always existed but it's been exacerbated by globalization, technological advancements and climate change - all factors that are making business cycles less predictable and more volatile than ever before. 

To help decision makers better understand this concept, I've put together my notes on this topic over the years and put them into a [popstack](https://app.popstack.ai/Kevin/Kevin's%20Compendium%20-%20Probability%20Management/5cc1ec42af1274057ac0d4ae). Popstack let's you the information consumer take any fragment from my notes that you find interesting and reuse it. Be that in a conversations or to reassemble into new meaningful contexts that are relevant to you. But I digress, this post is about the arithmetic of uncertainty. 

I'm talking about measuring uncertainty and using it in a way that is easy for non-math folks to understand. I've been using the term "uncertainty" to refer to the fact that we don't know the exact value of something. Traditionally, uncertainty is measured by the number of standard deviations away from the mean or how much it varies from the average. Let's forget all that for a moment.

Let's start with Probability Management. The big idea here is to represent uncertainties as data arrays called SIPs (stochastic information packet for the math geeks). SIPs obey both the laws of arithmetic and the laws of probability. Hence the arithmetic of uncertainty. Each value in the array represents a possible future outcome or scenario. Think of a 'what-if' scenario if you've every used Excel. 'What if we sold 1000 unites mores?' Change an input value to see what the outcome would be. Save all those inputs in an array and you have a SIP. Save all those what-if outputs and you have a SIP.

Uncertainty is a shape. One more time. Uncertainty is a shape.

Take the array of values and create a histogram. The histogram is a graph that represents the distribution of the values. The graph is a graph of the probability of each value. So, if you have a SIP of values that are all the same, the graph will be a straight line. If you have a SIP of values that are different, the graph may look like a bell curve or a sine wave or a barbell.

Why are SIPs important? Because it is now as easy to use the shape of an uncertainty as it is to plug a single average number into a formula or model. 

Why should organizations embrace probability management techniques?

- To cure the Flaw of Averages
- Make chance-informed decisions
- Roll-up risks and opportunities across the enterprise, blockchains, government agencies etc

There have been some very exciting advancements in probability management that make it easier than ever to share and reuse probability distributions. 

The Flaw of Averages has always existed but it's been exacerbated by globalization, leading to an increased need for people to make more decisions under uncertainty with greater consequences than ever before. To solve this problem, we can use chance-informed decision making, where uncertainty is embraced as an asset not a liability; risks are roll up and opportunities across the enterprise or government agencies become additive; learn how you can take advantage of the uncertainty in your decision making process, check out my [popstack](https://app.popstack.ai/Kevin/Kevin's%20Compendium%20-%20Probability%20Management/5cc1ec42af1274057ac0d4ae) on probability management.
