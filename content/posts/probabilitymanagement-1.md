"Decisions based on average numbers are wrong, on average." -Dr. Sam L. Savage

What is the arithmetic of uncertainty? It's a concept that is used to describe how much risk/opportunity there is in any situation. It's about measuring and quantifying uncertainties and sending those uncertainties through mathematical models. The more uncertain something is, the wider the range of possible outcomes. And it goes both ways: lower variability can indicate a greater degree of certainty as well. Uncertainty has always existed but it's been exacerbated by globalization, technological advancements, and climate change - all factors that are making business cycles less predictable and more volatile while decisions are being made in shorter intervals than ever before.

The big idea here is to represent uncertainties as data arrays called SIPs (stochastic information packet - for the math geeks). SIPs obey both the laws of arithmetic and the laws of probability. Hence the arithmetic of uncertainty. Each value in the array represents a possible future outcome or scenario. Think of a 'what-if' scenario if you've ever used Excel. 'What if we sold 1000 units more? Will we have enough inventory to fulfill the demand?’ In a spreadsheet we would change an input value to see what the outcome would be. Simple enough. Now imagine having millions of possible future outcomes. Save all those in an array and you have what we call a SIP.

Uncertainty has a shape. One more time. Uncertainty has a shape.

Take the array of those possible future values and create a histogram. The histogram is a graph that represents the distribution of the values. The graph depicts the probability of each possible future value. So, if you have a SIP of values that all have the same probability, the graph will be a straight line or what’s called a uniform distribution. Think of rolling a six sided die. The probability of rolling a 1 is the same as rolling any other number but many uncertainties have different shapes and their histogram may look like a bell curve, or a ski jump, a skateboard ramp and anything in between.

Why are SIPs important? Because they make it easy to use the shape of an uncertainty in a formula or spreadsheet model. Until now most people would use an average number in their spreadsheet. They may generate a sophisticated forecast that shapes the future but when it comes time to use that forecast they communicate the average and this leads to what Dr. Sam Savage calls the flaw of averages. In his book of the same name, he says, "Decisions based on average numbers are wrong, on average."
 
Forward-looking organizations embrace probability management techniques to cure this flaw, make chance-informed decisions and roll-up risks/opportunities across the enterprise. Recently there have been some very exciting advancements in probability management that make it easier than ever to create, store, share and reuse probability distributions.
