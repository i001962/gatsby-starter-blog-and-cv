It's time professional software started embracing new realities instead of focusing solely on creating longer chunks which do very little except frustrate us further at times by taking up valuable space on our screens.

Let's face it, we're all digital hoarders. The moment that information 'chucks' are combined into a document is when the re-use of those small chunks get limited to only one idea or person who needs them. This means now you must deconstruct documents into smaller fragments and choose relevant parts as needed to express another idea - which can be tedious!

Todayâ€™s business environment is one in which ideas are constantly being generated and new products developed. In this scenario, documents often need to be broken up into pieces that can then be incorporated with other information for a final product. Why do productivity and collaboration applications still focus on creating the traditional document? 

Social media and messaging platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter are transforming the way we communicate with one another. One of these changes is that individuals now can create content on their own instead of relying on a company or outlet to produce it for them.

The problem? Complex ideas needed in professional productivity cannot be created through social media alone; they need time-consuming effort like developing documentation before other people can understand what you mean - which means your employees may not know how much work goes into creating this type of material without firsthand experience because all they see is an occasional post from someone else detailing a project's progress step by step!

Presentation interfaces must become dynamic workspaces. The workspace needs to be as effective at communicating complex information in different formats and styles, while also being easy for users to reorganize the content they want on their screen quickly.

The [Popstack.ai](http://popstack.ai') vision is to turn information fragments into building blocks that you can stack and rearrange into self-contained streams of information - like social media and messaging, the act of consuming collections of tiny bits stimulates readers to engage with stories more easily. Any individual building block can be reused in a different stream or shared out for those who want an easy way getting caught up on what's going around them!

If you've read this far, you're probably thinking, "What the hell is this?" Well, I'm not sure. I'm just trying to get you to read the next few paragraphs. Just kidding. More seriously, I'm not writing this post. This entire article was written with the intention of helping you understand why you're missing the point but since it's using [GPT-3 technology](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/), it's not going to be easy to understand. AI is still very much in its infancy but it's already making huge strides. What I did to create this article was to create a simple AI that could generate a document of the correct length and format. I fed it a bunch of ideas and then asked it to generate a document. It did this by using a combination of Markov chains and a few other techniques to create a document that was as close to the original as possible. My colleague [@philip_lipetzpetz](https://twitter.com/philip_lipetz) created the original version of this [article](https://medium.com/@philip.lipetz/productivity-in-the-age-of-information-fragments-47b53811151e) which is much more pleasant to read.
