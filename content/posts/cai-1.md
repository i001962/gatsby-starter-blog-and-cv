Historical records that cannot be changed will become inexpensive and fast to produce.

Trust started among people, family members, friends, friends of friends, then moved to institutions where centralized authorities like banks and governments are the trusted entities that issue credentials and settle disputes. It has become common practice to trust the same entity that issues credentials to settle a dispute in the modern world. Issuing entities like bank accounts, credit cards, insurance companies, and governments are examples of large centralized institutions people default to trusting.

![Evolution of Trust](/media/trust.jpeg 'Trust')

Something important happened to the banking system in medieval and Renaissance Italy. In 1199 Fibonacci brought Arabic numerals back to Italy. They were using Roman numerals and an abacus before that! It's not a coincidence that merchant banking took off during the next 200 years as banks could more quickly assess risk and enable credit and trusted trade. 

Fast forward to the mid-1900s, when computers and electronic methods of calculating were invented. This enabled Fisher Black & Myron Scholes, in 1973, to create a standardized formula for measuring option value, which sparked the growth of the $1.2 quadrillion derivatives market (nominal value). By having a standard, trusted, mathematical formula, the market could be more efficient at identifying the value of options.

Fast forward again. Public Key encryption evolves, and by the 1990s, it enabled electronic signatures and privacy on internet purchases. Remember the early days of the internet when using a credit card on the web was risky? "Don't do that. They'll steal your credit card info." "No, this page is safe. See the lock in the toolbar." LOL this 'page.' It was too expensive and slow to secure more than the shopping cart checkout page. But Moore's law had its impact on encryption. Cheaper and faster it became. Today one can barely load a page into a Chrome browser unless the page is encrypted with an SSL certificate.

In 2009 Bitcoin was built on cryptographic primitives using distributed ledger technology. Mathematics continues to enable killer apps. This time a 'store of value.' By eliminating the so-called double spending problem, 'money' can be more efficiently moved. Balances are mathematically verified so market participants' claims on ownership can't be faked.
This sparks what some (including me) believe will be the overhaul of the $37 trillion dollar worldwide, centrally controlled (by a few powerful countries) money supply. We are approaching the era of the 'decentralized money supply'. It's the distributed ledger technology that enables a new kind of money; mathematics is the key to its success. BUT it's slow and expensive. We've seen this play before, and we know how it ends.

Decentralized, authoritative, mathematically verifiable historical records that cannot be changed will become inexpensive and fast to produce. These properties are now being built into many business applications at speeds that are in excess of one million hash transactions per second. It will not be long before all data created or moved has a mathematical proof associated with it. Just like the shopping cart page is no longer the only webpage secured, money movement won't be the only data secured.
